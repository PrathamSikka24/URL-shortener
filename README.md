# URL-shortener
In this project, I have designed a URL shortener service that takes a valid URL as input and returns a shortened URL redirecting the user to the previously provided URL.

It also has the feature of tracking the total number of views/clicks/ amount of traffic the URL has received.

Implemented RESTful services, and adequete routes.
